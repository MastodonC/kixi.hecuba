# Hecuba

A data platform built with [Clojure][CLJ], [ClojureScript][CLJS], [core.async][CORE.ASYNC], [Om][OM], Kafka, Cassandra and other technologies.

## Usage

Clone and install [Jig][JIG].

```
$ cd jig
jig/ $ lein install-all
```

The need to install is only due to the possibility that Hecuba is using a SNAPSHOT version of Jig which is gnot released to clojars.org.

Point Jig at Hecuba's config.

```
$ mkdir $HOME/.jig
$ ln -s kixi.hecuba/config.clj $HOME/.jig/config.clj
```

Start Jig

```
$ cd jig
jig/ $ lein repl
```

Navigate to http://localhost:8000

## Support

Hecuba is a new project which is being developed 'in the open'. Therefore it may not work exactly as described in these notes. Hecuba is not (yet) a released and supported code-base, rather it is being made available for others as a learning aid. Please bear this in mind when contacting the team, raising issues and submitting pull requests.
