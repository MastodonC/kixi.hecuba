# Hecuba

A data platform built with [Clojure][CLJ], [ClojureScript][CLJS], [core.async][CORE.ASYNC], [Om][OM], Kafka, Cassandra and other technologies.

## Usage

Clone and install [Jig][JIG].

```
$ cd jig
jig/ $ lein install-all
```

The need to install is only due to the possibility that Hecuba is using a SNAPSHOT version of Jig which is not released to clojars.org.

Point Jig at Hecuba's config.

```
$ mkdir $HOME/.jig
$ ln -s kixi.hecuba/config.clj $HOME/.jig/config.clj
```

Start Jig

```
$ cd jig
jig/ $ lein repl
```

Navigate to http://localhost:8000

## Dev environment

We are using Vagrant to manage dev environments.

+ Install VirtualBox v4.3.6 from [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) or preferably via your OS's package manager.
+ Install Vagrant v. 1.4.3 from [here](http://www.vagrantup.com/) or preferably via your OS's package manager.
+ install the vbguest plugin so Virtual Box guest additions will updated
  for you ``vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest``
+ ``cd ${PROJECT_HOME}``
+ ``vagrant up`` (This will download stuff the first time and will be slow, after that it will be quicker)
+ You will now have all the services required running in a virtual machine with the ports forwarded for access from your local machine

## Start an EC2 instance

+ make sure you have foreman installed
+ add the aws plugin ``vagrant plugin install vagrant-aws``

```
$ gem install foreman
```

+ copy env.example into .env and edit your AWS credentials in there
+ ``foreman run vagrant up --provider=aws``


## Support

Hecuba is a new project which is being developed 'in the open'. Therefore it may not work exactly as described in these notes. Hecuba is not (yet) a released and supported code-base, rather it is being made available for others as a learning aid. Please bear this in mind when contacting the team, raising issues and submitting pull requests.
