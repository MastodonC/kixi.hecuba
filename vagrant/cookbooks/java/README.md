Description
===========

This cookbook installs a Java JDK/JRE. It defaults to installing
OpenJDK, but it can also install Oracle and IBM JDKs.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**

As of 26 March 2012 you can no longer directly download the JDK from
Oracle's website without using a special cookie. This cookbook uses
that cookie to download the oracle recipe on your behalf, however the
`java::oracle` recipe forces you to set either override the
`node['java']['oracle']['accept_oracle_download_terms']` to true or
set up a private repository accessible by HTTP.

### Example

override the `accept_oracle_download_terms` in, e.g., `roles/base.rb`

    default_attributes(
      :java => {
         :oracle => {
           "accept_oracle_download_terms" => true
         }
       }
    )

Requirements
============

Chef 0.10.10+ and Ohai 6.10+ for `platform_family` use.

## Platform

* Debian, Ubuntu
* CentOS, Red Hat, Fedora, Scientific, Amazon, XenServer
* ArchLinux
* FreeBSD
* SmartOS
* Windows

This cookbook includes cross-platform testing support via
`test-kitchen`, see `TESTING.md`.

Attributes
==========

See `attributes/default.rb` for default values.

* `node['java']['remove_deprecated_packages']` - Removes the now
deprecated Ubuntu JDK packages from the system, default `false`
* `node['java']['install_flavor']` - Flavor of JVM you would like
installed (`oracle`, `openjdk`, `ibm`, `windows`), default `openjdk`
on Linux/Unix platforms, `windows` on Windows platforms.
* `node['java']['jdk_version']` - JDK version to install, defaults to
  `'6'`.
* `node['java']['java_home']` - Default location of the
  "`$JAVA_HOME`".

  the EULA for openjdk package installation.

Recipes
=======

## default

Include the default recipe in a run list, to get `java`.  By default
the `openjdk` flavor of Java is installed, but this can be changed by
using the `install_flavor` attribute. By default on Windows platform
systems, the `install_flavor` is `windows`.

OpenJDK is the default because of licensing changes made upstream by
Oracle. See notes on the `oracle` recipe below.

## openjdk

This recipe installs the `openjdk` flavor of Java. It also uses the
`alternatives` system on RHEL/Debian families to set the default Java.

On platforms such as SmartOS that require the acceptance of a license
agreement during package installation, set
`node['java']['accept_license_agreement']` to true in order to indicate
that you accept the license.

## oracle

This recipe installs the `oracle` flavor of Java. This recipe does not
use distribution packages as Oracle changed the licensing terms with
JDK 1.6u27 and prohibited the practice for both RHEL and Debian family
platforms.

For both RHEL and Debian families, this recipe pulls the binary
distribution from the Oracle website, and installs it in the default
`JAVA_HOME` for each distribution. For Debian, this is
`/usr/lib/jvm/default-java`. For RHEl, this is `/usr/lib/jvm/java`.

After putting the binaries in place, the `java::oracle` recipe updates
`/usr/bin/java` to point to the installed JDK using the
`update-alternatives` script. This is all handled in the `java_ark`
LWRP.

## oracle_i386

This recipe installs the 32-bit Java virtual machine without setting
it as the default. This can be useful if you have applications on the
same machine that require different versions of the JVM.

This recipe operates in a similar manner to `java::oracle`.

## oracle_rpm

This recipe installs the Oracle JRE or JDK provided by a custom YUM
repositories.
It also uses the `alternatives` system on RHEL families to set
the default Java.

## windows

Because there is no easy way to pull the java msi off oracle's site,
this recipe requires you to host it internally on your own http repo.

## ibm

The `java::ibm` recipe is used to install the IBM version of Java.
Note that IBM requires you to create an account *and* log in to
download the binary installer for your platform. You must accept the
license agreement with IBM to use their version of Java. In this
cookbook, you indicate this by setting
`node['java']['ibm']['accept_ibm_download_terms']` to `true`. You must
also host the binary on your own HTTP server to have an automated
installation. The `node['java']['ibm']['url']` attribute must be set
to a valid https/http URL; the URL is checked for validity in the recipe.

At this time the `java::ibm` recipe does not support multiple SDK
installations.

Resources/Providers
===================

This cookbook contains the `java_ark` LWRP. Generally speaking this
LWRP is deprecated in favor of `ark` from the
[ark cookbook](https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/ark), but it is
still used in this cookbook for handling the Oracle JDK installation.

By default, the extracted directory is extracted to
`app_root/extracted_dir_name` and symlinked to `app_root/default`

## Actions

- `:install`: extracts the tarball and makes necessary symlinks
- `:remove`: removes the tarball and run update-alternatives for all
  symlinked `bin_cmds`

## Attribute Parameters

- `url`: path to tarball, .tar.gz, .bin (oracle-specific), and .zip
  currently supported
- `checksum`: SHA256 checksum, not used for security but avoid
  redownloading the archive on each chef-client run
- `app_home`: the default for installations of this type of
  application, for example, `/usr/lib/tomcat/default`. If your
  application is not set to the default, it will be placed at the same
  level in the directory hierarchy but the directory name will be
   `app_root/extracted_directory_name + "_alt"`
- `app_home_mode`: file mode for app_home, is an integer
- `bin_cmds`: array of binary commands that should be symlinked to
  `/usr/bin`, examples are mvn, java, javac, etc. These cmds must be in
  the `bin` subdirectory of the extracted folder. Will be ignored if this
  `java_ark` is not the default
- `owner`: owner of extracted directory, set to "root" by default
- `default`: whether this the default installation of this package,
  boolean true or false

## Examples

    # install jdk6 from Oracle
    java_ark "jdk" do
        url 'http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/6u29-b11/jdk-6u29-linux-x64.bin'
        checksum  'a8603fa62045ce2164b26f7c04859cd548ffe0e33bfc979d9fa73df42e3b3365'
        app_home '/usr/local/java/default'
        bin_cmds ["java", "javac"]
        action :install
    end

Usage
=====

Simply include the `java` recipe where ever you would like Java installed.

To install Oracle flavored Java override the `node['java']['install_flavor']` attribute with in role:

    name "java"
    description "Install Oracle Java on Ubuntu"
    default_attributes(
      "java" => {
        "install_flavor" => "oracle"
      }
    )
    run_list(
      "recipe[java]"
    )

To install IBM flavored Java, set the required attributes:

    name "java"
    description "Install IBM Java on Ubuntu"
    default_attributes(
      "java" => {
        "install_flavor" => "ibm",
        "ibm" => {
          "accept_ibm_download_terms" => true,
          "url" => "http://fileserver.example.com/ibm-java-x86_64-sdk-7.0-4.1.bin",
          "checksum" => "The SHA256 checksum of the bin"
        }
      }
    )
    run_list(
      "recipe[java]"
    )


Development
===========

This cookbook uses
[test-kitchen](https://github.com/opscode/test-kitchen) for
integration tests and
[ChefSpec/RSpec](https://github.com/acrmp/chefspec) for unit tests.
Pull requests should pass existing tests in
`files/default/tests/minitest-handler`.

At this time due to licensing concerns, the IBM recipe is not set up
in test kitchen. If you would like to test this locally, copy
.kitchen.yml to .kitchen.local.yml and add the following suite:

    suites:
    - name: ibm
      run_list: ["recipe[java]"]
      attributes:
        java:
          install_flavor: "ibm"
          ibm:
            accept_ibm_download_terms: true
            url: "http://jenkins/ibm-java-x86_64-sdk-7.0-4.1.bin"
            checksum: the-sha256-checksum

Log into the IBM DeveloperWorks site to download a copy of the IBM
Java SDK you wish to use/test, host it on an internal HTTP server, and
calculate the SHA256 checksum to use in the suite.
