* Calculated Datasets dev notes
** Summary
*** Update existing difference series so that gaps are filled.
*** Use hourly rollups of those difference series for calculations.
**** May need to use a converted series m^3 -> kwh.
*** For a defined dataset, calculate total kwh.
**** check all sensors have same period.
***** TODO Do what if they're not?
**** Create a new hourly series - each entry sum of all sensors for that hour.
** Define dataset
*** Create an entry in datasets table.
** Test data
*** DSL to define test data.
** Scheduled job
*** for each entry in dataset table:
**** find all sensor metadata.
**** check hourly rollups for each exist
**** check all sensors are of same period.
**** If they are, sum
